decision: change the gamelog class to keep track of events in different matrices for different players

pros: 
makes it easier to divide gamelogs by player
makes it easier to remove noise from actions by pseudoplayers

cons:
adds additional complexity to the gamelog class 
not all events have player IDs (just put these event into their own matrix) 

what we need:
a data member to store the number of players in the replay
a list of event matrices instead of a single event matrix
rewrite the loadReplay method to divide events into separate matrices
rewrite the initializeMatrix method to initialize multiple event matrices

optional extras:
a list of players or a map of players to corresponding matrices

events that do have pid:
ability events
targetpointcommand events (right click)
camera events
chat events
selection events
control group events

events that do not have pid:
unit positions update events
unit born events
unit state change events (unit death, construction completion, burrowing, etc.)

note: 
unit born events have control_pid and upkeep_pid that correspond to pid
tracker events index pid from 1, the rest from 0
?what about unit owner change events (neural parasite) 

all game events have pid
tracker events don't have pid except:
	upgrade complete events
	player stats events
	player setup events
